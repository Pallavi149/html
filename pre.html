        <p>This is paragraph with many lines and
                 spaces without br tag and hr tag
                but browser ignors it </p> 
            <br> <pre>
                <p>This is another paragraph with 
                    many      spaces and
                    lines.
                    pre tag keeps the writing 
                    as it is and does not need any br or hr tags.
